<h1>Password Manager</h1>

Front-end: Angularjs/Html/Css/Bootstrap
Database: Local Storage

This project use Local storage to simulate database operation, so some feature is not like real app(Restful api).
The project have a autocomplete directive, it is a simple autocomplete made by me.
I want you see I can controll almost feature of Angular

The project have 2 main components: autocomplete, page_password.
I would like to construct like that. Because we can modularization all features. I help us manage easier and have reuse ability.
